**Self-reflection after the project**
- First, adding events to multiple buttons (something similar) can be facilitated by combining switch conditions and adding 1 event to the parent node of these buttons.
- To create effect for buttons, just need to change the margin bottom and color to somehow make them look like they are being clicked
- append or appendChild is adding new things to the current storage of textContent of a node => if want to update just use, (node).textContent = sth (this one kinda BS:)
- ALSOOOO, it's always best practice to remove margin and padding from h1 and p + border from button :D
